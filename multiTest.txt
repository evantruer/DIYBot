How to Care for Baby Mice.

Whether your adult mice had babies or you stumbled across abandoned baby mice, caring for these small, fragile infants can be a difficult task. Baby mice need to receive proper care within a few hours of being born in order to survive, so take immediate action if you find orphaned mice.

Helping the Mother Care for Her Babies

Watch the mother closely for signs of aggression or carelessness.

If the babies you are caring for have a mother, she will likely keep them alive. However, female mice are often careless towards their young, may abandon a litter, and may even eat some of their offspring.
If the mother stops feeding her young, or if she eats any babies, place her in a separate cage  If the mother is aggressive or does not care for the infants, you will need to feed and care for them yourself.

Find a foster mother if the mice are orphans.

If you know where to find another nursing female, she may accept the orphaned baby mice as her own. This is the best option, both psychologically and physically, for the babies but it is not always possible, especially if they are over 1.5 weeks old.
Quickly find a nursing mother from a pet store or breeder.  Rub the foster babies with bedding from the new mother’s cage to let them absorb her smells.  Place the babies in the mother’s tank.  Keep an eye out for signs of aggression, excessive squeaking, or abandonment.

Watch the babies for signs of diarrhea and dehydration.

Even if a biological or surrogate mother is taking care of the newborn mice, diarrhea and dehydration are common problems you may encounter when raising newborn mice. Dehydration occurs alongside diarrhea and can kill the babies if not treated.
A swollen tummy, lethargy, and yellowish discharge from the anus are signs of diarrhea.  Replace the mother’s milk or formula with an electrolyte solution for human infants.  Take the babies to a vet to ensure they are healthy.

Feeding Baby Mice

Prepare formula to feed the mice.

Your local pet store will carry many different formula options, such as Kitten Milk Replacer or Esbilac, that can be used to feed baby mice. Human formulas Enfamil  and Soyalac can also be used. Whole, raw goats milk will nourish the babies as well.
Slightly warm the formula or milk before feeding; do not use hot or cold formula.  Powered formulas will need to be mixed with water per the directions on the container.

Use a small syringe, small nursing bottle, or absorbent string for feeding.

You can also use an eyedropper. If you are using a syringe or bottle, suck liquid up into the container to prepare for feeding. If you are using string, simply dip it into the formula until it is dripping.

Place small drops of food into the mouth.

Take care to not squeeze the syringe or bottle with much force. If you see liquid bubbling from their noses, stop feeding immediately. When the mice have round, full tummies, they do not need any more food.

Feed the mice frequently.

Mice ages 0-1 week need feedings 6-8 times a day; mice 1-2 weeks need feedings 5-6 times a day; mice 2-3 weeks need feedings 4 times a day; and mice 4 weeks old only need feedings 3 times a day. Space each feeding a couple of hours apart. You will also have to feed the mice during the night.

Stimulate the babies after feeding so they use the bathroom.

 Use a cotton ball or your finger, and gently brush over their private areas. A small amount of liquid will come out, but if the baby is dehydrated, nothing may come out. Rub until there is no more liquid.

Wean the babies after three to four weeks.

 For the first several days of weaning, provide a small amount of moistened rodent pellets for the weaning mice; drizzle water over the pellets to prepare them, then place them in an easily accessible area.
Soon, the mice will be nibbling at the soaked crumbles.  When the mice appear to be getting stronger, try feeding them regular rodent pellets.

Provide healthy pellets and water once the babies are weaned.

Pet supply stores have rodent chow available, whether it comes in blocks or pellets. Choose a formula that is 16% protein, 18% fiber, and less than 4% fat to raise healthy mice.
You no longer have to wet the pellets.  You can provide apples, bananas, broccoli, and other snacks, but remember that mice have tiny stomachs and should not overeat.  Mice usually drink 3-7 ml of water per day. Hang a small animal water bottle in the cage, and keep it filled.  Before, the mice were getting water from their food, but now they eat dry food, and the water bottle is necessary.

Providing a Suitable Living Environment

Provide a cage with at least 1 cubic foot of space per mouse.

 This amount of space is necessary even if the babies are not fully grown. Your local pet store will have many cages to choose from, but be sure to buy one big enough.

Choose a proper cage.

Mouse cages should not provide spaces where the mice can escape and should have a solid floor . Plastic cages will often become damaged after cleaning, so opt instead for metal and glass cages or aquariums that can withstand thorough cleanings.
Mice are very good at chewing, so choose a cage without protruding parts and wires the mice can chew on.  Provide hiding spots for the mice, such as small boxes or cardboard tubes.  Using a cardboard box for the babies is only a temporary option, as mice will quickly learn to chew through the box and escape.

Provide clean bedding in the cage.

Wood shavings or shredded, recycled paper products will suffice. Avoid cedar and pine shavings. Clean the bedding as soon as it is soiled, which can be as often as twice a day, and disinfect the entire cage every three to four weeks.

Keep the cage between 75°F  and 90°F .

This will keep the babies warm and comfortable. Use your at-home heater and air conditioner to monitor the temperature.

How to Treat Chronic Vomiting in Cats.

The term "chronic" implies a longstanding condition, so chronic vomiting refers to sickness that has been going on for more than two or three weeks. The vomiting can be intermittent, meaning that it occurs every two or three days, or it can be constant, which means that it happens after every meal. The way that you treat your cat will depend on her overall health.

Treating a Cat Who is Otherwise Healthy

Determine if your cat is healthy aside from her chronic vomiting.

If your cat is healthy despite vomiting often, it means that there is most likely no underlying medical cause that needs to be treated. Instead, aspects of your cat’s lifestyle might need to be changed. Signs that this may be the case include:
Your cat is not losing weight.  Your cat acts like she normally does, and seems generally healthy.  Your cat only vomits once every two to three days.  Keep in mind that if your cat’s health gets worse, the vomiting gets more frequent, or your cat becomes lethargic or loses weight, you should seek the help of a veterinarian.

Adjust your cat’s food.

If the vomiting coincided with a change of diet, put your cat back onto a type of food that she was fine with before the chronic vomiting began. Some cats can have food intolerance, or food allergy, and it is possible that the new food contains a protein your cat is allergic to.
When a cat eats a protein that she is sensitive to, the protein molecule bridges a receptor in the bowel wall, which triggers an inflammatory reaction. It is this inflammation that causes the vomiting. When the food that is causing the allergy is taken away, the inflammation should settle in one to two days.

Switch your cat to a bland diet to help settle her stomach.

A cat with chronic vomiting that is fed a rich diet, such as a premium supermarket food, may be sensitive to the humectants and additives, or indeed the rich nature of the food itself. Try changing your cat’s diet to a bland, white meat diet such as chicken breast, turkey, rabbit, cod, or coley.
Feed your cat 100% meat, rather than a meat-flavored food. An average-sized cat needs roughly 250 kcal a day; this is equivalent to feeding your cat around 250 grams of chicken breast a day.  An alternative to meat is to feed your cat one of the many prescription diets that are designed to speed up the healing of the bowel. Diets like Hills ID or Purina HA are ideal for a cat recovering from sickness.

Give your cat Famotidine.

Famotidine is commonly sold as Pepcid AC. If your cat’s mucosal lining in her stomach is damaged, then giving her medications to repair the lining can help to stop the vomiting. When the lining is damaged, the stomach acid can eat away at the exposed stomach wall. Antacid medications such as famotidine decrease stomach acid production and give the lining a chance to repair itself while the inflammation subsides.
This drug should be used with caution in cats with heart disease because it can slow the heart rate. However this is usually only a problem when the medication is given intravenously.  The prescribed dose is generally 0.5 mg/kg once a day by mouth. A 5 kg cat thus requires 2.5 mg; the lowest tablet size is 10 mg, which equates to a quarter of a tablet, once a day.

Talk to your vet about giving your cat non-prescription gastroprotectants.

Kaolin and Pectin  are both gastroprotectants that can help to protect the lining of your cat’s bowels. The kaolin and pectin absorb toxins produced in the gut, and also line the gut wall to provide a protective barrier.
However, this medication is not effective in all cats. Consider calling your vet before giving this medication to your cat.

Identifying the Underlying Cause and Treating It

Bring your cat to the vet.

If your cat is unwell and vomiting, then seek veterinary advice. Vomiting is usually a symptom of a problem rather than a diagnosis in itself. Identifying the cause of the vomiting and treating the underlying problem will help to stop the sickness.
The following steps cover common underlying causes that may cause your cat to develop chronic vomiting.

Determine whether the vomit is a reaction to a drug.

If the mucosal barrier lining the stomach is damaged, digestive acids come into contact with the stomach wall and cause an erosion, or ulcer. Certain medications such as steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  can cause side effects which include gastric ulceration that leads to vomiting.
Diagnosis: An ulcer may be suspected if the cat has a recent history of taking NSAIDs or other medications; especially if they were given on an empty stomach by accident . Imaging such as ultrasound or endoscopy  may be required to identify the lesion.  Treatment: Treatment involves stopping the medication that caused the initial problem, and using gastroprotectants and antacid drugs to help your cat’s stomach to heal.

Look for signs of a liver infection.

Liver infection  is commonly associated with vomiting. This is a self-seeded infection where bacteria from the bowel reflux up the bile duct and create an infection in the liver. Cats with cholangiohepatitis vomit, have poor appetites, and may be jaundiced.
Diagnosis: Your veterinarian will run blood tests to look for raised liver enzymes, and a high white cell count. He or she will also scan the liver using an ultrasound, in order to make a diagnosis.  Treatment: The majority of cats respond well to a therapy of antibiotics, anti-sickness injections, and intravenous fluids if the cat is dehydrated.

Treat kidney disease.

A diseased kidney is not efficient at filtering the natural waste products of the digestive process. Instead, these toxins gradually build up in the blood where they cause inflammation and ulceration of the stomach lining, and sometimes the gums.
Diagnosis: Kidney disease is usually diagnosed with a blood screen, which measures the levels of toxic metabolites such as urea and creatinine, and the build-up of minerals such a phosphate.  Treatment: Treatment includes putting your cat on a prescription food that is low in toxic metabolites. Another treatment is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  such as benazepril. ACEI work by inhibiting an enzyme cascade that causes blood vessel contraction. This leads to a dilation of the blood vessels supplying the kidney, which mean blood supply to the kidney is increased.

Lower your cat’s phosphate levels.

Phosphate, which is associated with kidney disease, is recognized as a cause of nausea in cats. However, cats can also have an increased phosphate level without having kidney disease if the phosphate levels are lowered early on.
Diagnosis: Like with kidney disease, vets can use a blood screen to look for a build-up of phosphate.  Treatment: The use of phosphate binders such a Renalzin, which is added to food and binds to the phosphate content, means less phosphate gets into the bloodstream. Renalzin comes in a pump; a typical dose in one or two pumps, twice a day with food.

Work with your vet to treat your cat for pancreatitis.

Pancreatitis is a painful condition in which digestive juices leak into the tissue of the pancreas. This causes a lot of local inflammation, pain, and irritation, which can lead to vomiting.
Treatment through diet: Mild cases of pancreatitis can be managed with a bland diet, which requires less digestive juices to process than fatty diets.  Treatment through medication: Very sick cats need hospitalization for supportive care with intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and pain relief. The antiemetic most commonly used is maropitant.

Understand that overactive thyroid glands can lead to vomiting.

The thyroid produces thyroxine, which is a hormone that governs metabolic rate. Too much thyroxine acts like a stimulant, a bit like being permanently high on caffeine. It overstimulates the gut and can cause sickness and diarrhea.
Diagnosis: Your veterinarian will diagnose the condition by feeling for enlarged thyroid glands in the neck and running blood tests to check the levels of thyroid hormones in your cat’s bloodstream.  Treatment: Treatment for hyperthyroidism includes giving your cat a medication called Thiamazole  that regulates the production of thyroid hormones.

Help your cat get rid of Helicobacteria.

This is a spiral shaped bacterium which burrows into the stomach lining, causes inflammation, and can make your cat vomit.
Treatment: Treatment helicobacteria with a combination of antibiotics. This combination includes either doxycycline with metronidazole, or amoxicillin with metronidazole. You will most likely have to give your cat these antibiotics for 10 to 21 days.

Understand that a foreign body in your cat’s stomach can make your cat sick.

A hairball or a small toy can sit in your cat’s stomach and rattle around, much like a lone sock inside a tumble dryer. The foreign body either blocks the exit to the stomach, or else it irritates the stomach lining, and makes the cat sick.
Diagnosis: Your vet will diagnose the foreign body through x-rays or ultrasounds after a thoroughly physical examination.  Treatment: Removing foreign bodies generally involves surgery. A laparotomy is generally used to gain access to the stomach.
